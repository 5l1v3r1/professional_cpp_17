“Tuples are sequences with a fixed size that can have heterogeneous elements and are defined in the <tuple> header file. All standard template library containers discussed further in this chapter store homogenous elements, meaning that all the elements in a container must have the same type. A tuple allows you to store elements of completely unrelated types in one object. ”
