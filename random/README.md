# Random Numbers

“C++11 adds a complete random number library, which is much more powerful than the old C++ way of generating random numbers. The new library comes with uniform random number generators, random number engines, random number engine adaptors, and random number distributions. All of these can be used to give you random numbers more suited to your problem domain, such as normal distributions, negative exponential distributions, etc.”
