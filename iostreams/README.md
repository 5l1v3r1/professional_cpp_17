“C++ introduces a new model for input and output using streams. The C++ library provides routines for reading and writing built-in types from and to files, console/keyboard, and strings. C++ also provides the facilities for coding your own routines for reading and writing your own objects. Chapter 1 reviews the basics of I/O streams. Chapter 15 provides the details of streams.”
