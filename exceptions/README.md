“The C++ language supports exceptions, which allow functions or methods to pass errors of various types up to calling functions or methods. The C++ standard library provides a class hierarchy of exceptions that you can use in your program as is, or that you can subclass to create your own exception types. Chapter 10 covers the details of exceptions and the standard exception classes.”
