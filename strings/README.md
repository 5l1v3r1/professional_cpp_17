“C++ provides a built-in string class. Although you may still use C-style strings of character arrays, the C++ string class is superior in almost every way. It handles the memory management; provides some bounds checking, assignment semantics, and comparisons; and supports manipulations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and substring or character replacement.”
